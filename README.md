My Code Louisville FSJS Projectis a web app designed to let users keep all their coding information in one place. 
They will be able to keep important links, to-do lists, code snipits, notes, and much more. However the only current function
is the favorites links, which is a fully customizable menu where you can keep any number of links and organize them by different menus.

Once you have downloaded the project files:
1- Go to the root directory of project
2- Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
3- Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
4- Run ‘npm start’ to begin the app server process
5- Open a localhost windows to the port it’s running on.

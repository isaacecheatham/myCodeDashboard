My Code Louisville FSJS Projectis a web app designed to let users keep all their coding information in one place. 
They will be able to keep important links, to-do lists, code snipits, notes, and much more. However the only current function
is the favorites links, which is a fully customizable menu where you can keep any number of links and organize them by different menus.

Once you have downloaded the project files:
1. Go to the root directory of project
2. Run ‘npm install’ to install necessary packages
3. Run ‘mongod’ to start mongo service
4. Run ‘npm start’ or "node app.js" to begin the app server process
5. Open a localhost windows to port 3030
6. Use the menu icon or large buttons to begin using the favorites menu.
7. Test links after adding to verify they function as expected, if not modify them to include www. or https://
8. When you use a mobile device the menu/header will change and the page content will now be pushed instead of hovered over
